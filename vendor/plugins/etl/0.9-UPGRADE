The 0.9 revision of ActiveWarehouse ETL significantly changes how connections are maintained. This release is not backwards compatible.

To upgrade, you must do the following:

1.) All database connections used in ETL control files must be declared in database.yml in the directory that contains your ETL control files.
2.) All sources, destinations, transforms and processors that use a database connection must include the configuration name/value pair of :target => 'name' where name is replaced with the connection name defined in database.yml. Connection information should no longer be included in control files.
