Hello <%= @user.name %>,

You've just created an account for the NB Aquatic Data Warehouse's data entry 
application.  You're first step should be to activate your account by clicking 
on the link below or copy & pasting it into your browser:

<%= activate_url(@user.activation_code) %>

You will then be able to login with the username '<%= @user.login %>' and the 
password you specified.  (Note: the login and password recovery features will
not work unless you have activated your account)

Also, here are some important URLs for your account:
- Login: <%= login_url %>
- Password Recovery: <%= forgot_password_url %>
- Edit Profile: <%= edit_user_url(@user) %> (you must be logged in to access this)

Thanks for registering!
