    <p>This is a list of sites where data has been collected. The list will be
      limited to your area of interest as defined by your user profile. The list
      includes the Data Warehouse assigned Site ID, the agencies who have collected
      data at this site and their site IDs; the water body and its associated water
      body ID and drainage code; site description; types of data collected at each
      site and the number of records of each type of data. Only water chemistry
    data is accessible at this point.</p>

    <% help_section 'Sort List' do %>

  <% help_section 'Download Data' do %>
    <p>Click on <strong>Download All</strong> found at top of the Data Collection
      Sites list (to the right) to download the water chemistry data for the sites
      currently displayed in the Data Collection Sites list. The data will be
      exported as text file (.csv) which can be opened by most software packages
      including MS Excel and Access. The download process prompts the viewer to
    select whether to open the file in Excel or to Save the file.</p>
  <% end %>

  <% help_section 'Search' do %>
    <p>Click on <strong>Search</strong> (top right) to display a text box to enter a water
      body name, site name, watershed code, agency code and/or data set as search
      criteria.  The system will search for partial text strings. For example,
      &ldquo;Miramichi&rdquo; returns SW Miramichi River, NW Miramichi River, Miramichi Lake,
    etc.</p>

    <p>Add &ldquo;watershed&rdquo; or &ldquo;basin&rdquo; after a water body name to search for sites
      within the drainage area. For example: entering &ldquo;Hammond River&rdquo; will show a
      list of sites for only Hammond River. Enter &ldquo;Hammond River Watershed&rdquo; and the
      resulting list will include sites for Hammond River and all its
    tributaries.</p>

    <p>Use &ldquo;+&rdquo; to search on multiple items, such as water body + agency code +
    data set name. For example, Hammond River + HRAA + water chemistry</p>
