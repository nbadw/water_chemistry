<h3>Browse Data Collection Sites</h3>
<p><strong>Site List</strong> - This is a list of sites where data has been collected. The list will be limited to your area of interest as defined by your user profile. The list includes the Data Warehouse assigned Site ID, the agencies who have collected data at this site and their site IDs; the water body and its associated water body ID and drainage code; site description; types of data collected at each site and the number of records of each type of data. Only water chemistry data is accessible at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Sort List</strong> - The site list can be sorted by clicking on the Site ID, Water Body ID, Water Body Name or Watershed Code heading.</p>
<p><strong>Agency Code Look Up</strong> – Clicking on the agency code(s) within a record opens a sub-list of the agency names.</p>
<p><strong>Watershed Information</strong> – Place the mouse over the watershed code to display a translation of the hierarchal drainage codes. </p>
<p><strong>Filter By Area of Interest / Show All Sites</strong> – Click on this toggled option (top right) to toggle area of interest as defined by your user profile on or off. <strong>Show All Sites</strong> turns off the filter and displays all data collection sites.</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong> - Click on this option (top right) to display a text box to enter a water body name, site name, watershed code, agency code and/or data set as search criteria.  The system will search for partial text strings. For example, “Miramichi” returns SW Miramichi River, NW Miramichi River, Miramichi Lake, etc.
  <br/><br/>Add “watershed” or “basin” after a water body name to search for sites within the drainage area. For example: entering “Hammond River” will show a list of sites for only Hammond River. Enter “Hammond River Watershed” and the resulting list will include sites for Hammond River and all its tributaries.
  <br/><br/>Use “+” to search on multiple items, such as water body + agency code + data set name. For example, Hammond River + HRAA + water chemistry
The Reset option will return the full list of data collection sites.</p>
